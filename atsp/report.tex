This report describes my findings in an attempt to solve an
asymmetric travelling salesman problem through the approach
of genetic algorithm.

The solution utilizes fitness score as integer for increased precision
and speed. For certain application the fitness can be converted to
ratios of fitness represendet as floating point numbers via rank-function
that returns a sorted list of individuals


Set up a list of possible constraints this exercise falls under:

    _Problem specific:
    Encoding (yes/no)? If yes, which one?
    Uniqueness of a gene in a chromosome
    Uniqueness of a chromosome in the pool
    Length of a chromosome (fixed or variable)
    Size of the population (fixed or variable)
    Evaluation strategy: ranking, normalization, distribution
    The representation of fitness: minimalization or maximalization problem?
    Termination conditions
    Ordering is important: which crossover needs does this lead to?


    _Algorithm specific:
    Parent selection
    Survivor selection


It might be a good practice to encode all the data at once, and decode only
when visual feedback is needed.

Do a progress evaluation: a period of no progress
(in comparison to the previous): STOP
